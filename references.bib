  abstract = {Abstract                            Good programmers break their projects into a number of pieces, each to be processed or compiled by a different chain of programs. After a set of changes is made, the series of actions that must be taken can be quite complex, and costly errors are frequently made. This paper describes a program that can keep track of the relationships between parts of a program, and issue the commands needed to make the parts consistent after changes are made.

  abstract = {The utility simply known as make is one of the most enduring features of both Unix and other operating systems. First invented in the 1970s, make still turns up to this day as the central engine in most programming projects; it even builds the Linux kernel. In the third edition of the classic Managing Projects with GNU make, readers will learn why this utility continues to hold its top position in project build software, despite many younger competitors. The premise behind make is simple: after you change source files and want to rebuild your program or other output files, make checks timestamp},
